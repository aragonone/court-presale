# Court presale and fundraising

# App

The `app/` folder contains a simplified version of [Aragon Fundraising](https://github.com/AragonBlack/fundraising) presale app used for Aragon Court launch.

# Template

The `template/` folder contains a template to deploy a pseudo-DAO (it doesn't have any kind of governance, but it's externally owned) used to deploy the presale and the bonding curve used to convert ANT to ANJ in order to participate in Aragon Court as a juror.
The external owner of that instance will be the Aragon Network DAO. See [AGP 126](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/pull/126).
